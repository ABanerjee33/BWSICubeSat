###### VERSION 4.8.13 ######

###### Final testing version ######

# Script for determining the percentage of each color using PIL and using RGB representation.
# Pushes the associated files to the github repo specified in git_push()..

# INPUT: To run this code, simply enter "python3 color_id.py FILE_PATH", where FILE_PATH is the image you would like to process
# If you do not type anything after "color_id.py", the pi will take a picture automatically and use that for the processing

# OUTPUT:
#    Prints the number of pixels of different colors (RGB White Black other) in the original Image
#    Prints the percentage of pixels of each color (RGB, White) in the original Image,
#    relative to both the rest of the plastic and the posterboard
#    Creates and saves several pictures (.jpg) the most important of which are:
#        'new_image' + time string: the original image, but filtered into RGB White Black
#        'denoised' + time string: new_image, but cleaned up to remove some stray pixels
#        'overwrite' + time string: the original image, where the shapes have been turned white and everything else is black
#    Prints the number of pieces of plastic of each color and size in the image.
#    Prints the total runtime of the program.


#TODO: At the bottom of the script, set the variable YOUR_NAME to be your name (just first is fine). Also, make sure you do git pull
# before you run this script, because it will push to GitHub automatically once it's run.
# Also, you will need to install skimage before running this code. (At this point, technically you don't,
# so if you're having problems with it, just delete the "from skimage import measure" line (line 35 or so)

#TODO: Remember to adjust the brightness function, colors, and pixel width of the squares in your images. 
# These are marked with "TODO" comments, and put between #=====================# lines.
# You can also adjust other things, but be careful you don't break the code (just because it can be time consuming to fix).

#TODO: Please copy this file into another folder or directory so you're not editing this exact file.
